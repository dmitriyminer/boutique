# Notifier - A stock notifier program.

## One line summary

Tracks stock buys and sells, notifying the user when those points are reached.

## The long summary

This is a simple example application I made using Boutique as the central store
and updating listeners when changes occurred.

The application simply takes in some stock symbols, when you wish to buy
and when you wish to sell, and notifies you through some desktop notification
library of the event.

It is not very sophisticated and doesn't contain a bunch of tests.
